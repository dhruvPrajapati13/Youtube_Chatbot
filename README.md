#YouTube Video Chatbot with RAG#
This project demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot that can answer questions about a YouTube video's content using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the video transcript and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a concise answer.
